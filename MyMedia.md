My favorite song at the moment has to be "I heard it through the grapvine" by Marvin Gaye. I am in love with this song right now because of how much soul Marvin Gaye puts into it. It is just too groovy to ignore.

### A little typescript snippet

The following code snippet is a TypeScript code snippet. This snippet is used to get the value of an object in an interface.

```
interface MyInterface {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  properties: string[];
}

const myObject: MyInterface = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'foo',
  properties: ['a', 'b', 'c']
};

function getValue(value: keyof MyInterface) {
  return myObject[value];
}

getValue('id'); // 1
getValue('count')
```
